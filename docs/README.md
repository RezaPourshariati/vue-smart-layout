# Documentation Index

This knowledge base is organized around architecture concepts, flows, decisions, and behavior — not file-by-file walkthroughs.

## How we write docs (“one page = one question”)

Each substantive page should:

1. **`## Primary Question`** — one sentence the reader came to answer.
2. **`## Short answer`** — a few bullets (current behavior only).
3. **Body** — behavior, code anchors, trade-offs, scope.
4. **`## Out of scope for this page`** — links to the page that owns adjacent topics (avoid sprawl).

Split the page when it answers more than one primary question. Reference pages may use a lighter pattern but still state what question they answer.

## Start Here

- [`architecture/auth-and-session-architecture.md`](./architecture/auth-and-session-architecture.md) — end-to-end auth/session model and boundaries.
- [`decisions/adr-001-explicit-refresh-authority.md`](./decisions/adr-001-explicit-refresh-authority.md) — why refresh authority is explicit and centralized.

## Architecture

- [`architecture/auth-and-session-architecture.md`](./architecture/auth-and-session-architecture.md)

## Security and Session Policy

- [`security/session-policy.md`](./security/session-policy.md)
- [`security/token-model-and-cookie-strategy.md`](./security/token-model-and-cookie-strategy.md)

## Frontend Orchestration

- [`frontend/auth-orchestration.md`](./frontend/auth-orchestration.md)
- [`frontend/routing-auth-guards.md`](./frontend/routing-auth-guards.md)

## Backend Session Handling

- [`backend/access-validation-middleware.md`](./backend/access-validation-middleware.md)

## Request and Session Flows

- [`flows/idle-timeout-and-absolute-timeout-flow.md`](./flows/idle-timeout-and-absolute-timeout-flow.md)

## Architecture Decisions / Trade-offs

- [`decisions/adr-001-explicit-refresh-authority.md`](./decisions/adr-001-explicit-refresh-authority.md)

## Reference
